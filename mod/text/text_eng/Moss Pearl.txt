At first glance, it appears to be a rock with moss all over it, but upon closer inspection.. 

I have realized its almost too perfectly round to be a rock, so it must be a pearl!

I have no way of reading its contents, but this is a fascinating discovery.

Judging by the hole through the center, it appears that this was a pearl used by scavengers for trade.

In the time since it was misplaced moss has grown right through its hollow axis.

Maybe I would be able to read what's on it if you tried to remove the moss somehow? <LINE>I'm unsure if that would even help, since metals in the soil seem to have degraded its structure. 

That means most of the data is most likely destroyed, so just keep it as it is, it looks kinda pretty!

Just please take it with you as you leave, I would prefer not to have moss growing into my puppet.
