This is interesting! This pearl is very old, seems to be written by a very early prototype of us Iterators!

It describes the part of an old Storage Complex which was used before and after we were built...<LINE>I wonder whats left in it now. Perhaps you know!

At the time this pearl was written, it looks like there used to be pearls, old belongings, pre-made complex wiring and neon light mechanisms<LINE>as well as some other mundane items.

The Storage Complex was but a small part of the Urban Center, did you know? Our creators resided there,<LINE>they ran into an issue more typical of lesser creatures.

Their cities became so overcrowded some even had to call the cramped boxes of the Storage Complex their home.<LINE>Perhaps that was better than nothing to them.
