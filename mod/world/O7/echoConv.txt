This city used to be teeming with life.

Silence fills the the spaces of empty chatter and idle work I once knew.

What brings you here, to this long forgotten place?

Are you looking for something, perhaps? I am afraid you will not find it,<LINE> this place has long since been abandoned, you see.

Everyone left, but I stayed behind.

Gone to their great cities above the clouds. Ever shinier, ever taller.

Do they miss me?

How long has it been now?

Are they even still up there?
